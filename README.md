API
8. Fake JSON API being used:
  https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/
  1. Go down to the resources section and click on the /todos link
  2. We will make a network request to this URL with endpoint being todos -- >  [https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1)

***  What am I building?  ***
I am building a small application that will make a network request to an outside api, fetch data, 
then we are going to print the data inside our terminal'

This is just to see why typescript is used and catch bugs with it.
